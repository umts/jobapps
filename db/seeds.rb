Configurable site text is interpreted and shown to end users using a protocol known as Markdown. This means that you can do some of your own text formatting. Here's how:

+ Surround text with \*asterisks\* or \_underscores\_for *italic text*
+ Surround text with \*\*double asterisks\*\* or \_\_double underscores\_\_ for **bold text**
+ Start lines with a plus (`+`), a minus (`-`), or an asterisk (`*`) to make a list (that's how we made this one!).
+ For links, write the link text in [brackets] followed by the destination in (parentheses). Here's an example:
+ Typing '`[our homepage](https://umasstransit.org)`' outputs the following link: [our homepage](https://umasstransit.org)

For additional information, we like to reference [this tutorial](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (and if you're feeling particularly meta, feel free to check out [how we wrote a Markdown tutorial in Markdown](/site_texts/#{markdown_text.id}/edit)).
