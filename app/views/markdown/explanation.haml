%h1 Markdown explanation
%p Markdown is used in question rendering and here is simple guide to get you started.

:markdown 
  - Surround text with \*asterisks\* or \_underscores\_ for *italic text*
  - Surround text with \*\*double asterisks\*\* or \_\_double underscores\_\_ for **bold text**
  - Start lines with a plus (`+`), a minus (`-`), or an asterisk (`*`) to make a list (that is how we made this one!).
    For links, write the link text in [brackets] followed by the destination in (parentheses). Here's an example: 
  - Typing '`[our homepage](https://umasstransit.org)`' outputs the following link: [our homepage](https://umasstransit.org)
  - For additional exercise, you can refer to the markdown editor below:
