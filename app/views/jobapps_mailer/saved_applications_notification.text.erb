Hello,

The following applications which you had saved for later have been moved back to the dashboard and are now ready for your review:

<% @records.each_pair do |position, records| %>
Position: <%= position.name %>
<% records.each do |record| %>
  Applicant: <%= record.user.full_name %>,
  Applied on: <%= format_date_time record.created_at %>
  <%- if @record.note_for_later.present? %>
  Note: <%= @record.note_for_later %>
  <%- end %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
